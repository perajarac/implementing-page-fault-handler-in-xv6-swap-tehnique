# Introduction



The goal of this task is to implement a part of the virtual memory system. The virtual memory system should provide the following functionalities: page swapping to swap space and preventing thrashing. 
Multiple processes that share physical memory can exist in the system.  It is necessary to enable page swapping by transferring pages to a hard disk. Functions for accessing disk blocks are provided for accessing the swap space on the hard disk.
The task consists of two parts. The first part is mandatory, and the student must complete it to successfully defend the project task. Page replacement algorithms, free space allocation, page sharing, demand paging, and other algorithms and optimizations
are left to the solution itself and will be considered only within the performance testing of the system.
